Issue 010: Tests skipped on Cygwin when they should run

Current Status:
- 3 tests skipped: 1 for "psutil not available", 2 for "Custom setuptools commands removed"
- Running on Cygwin where psutil-cygwin should provide transparent import
- Tests should NOT be skipped on the target platform

Analysis:

1. SKIP: "psutil not available (may not be installed)"
   - Location: TestRealTransparentImport.test_transparent_import_basic_functionality() 
   - Problem: Test tries to import psutil but fails
   - Root Cause: .pth file not configured OR standard psutil not installed
   - On Cygwin: This test SHOULD run since psutil-cygwin provides psutil

2. SKIP: "Custom setuptools commands removed during modernization" (2 tests)
   - Location: TestInstallationIntegration, TestCygwinDetection classes
   - Problem: Tests were disabled during modernization 
   - Root Cause: Tests referenced old setuptools commands that no longer exist
   - Solution: Replace with modern equivalent tests

Root Issues:

A. Transparent Import Not Configured
   - No psutil.pth file exists in site-packages
   - psutil-cygwin-setup install not run after package installation
   - Standard psutil may be installed instead

B. Test Logic Issues  
   - Test assumes transparent import is already working
   - Doesn't help user understand how to fix the setup
   - Skips instead of providing actionable feedback

C. Missing Modern Tests
   - Old setuptools command tests were disabled
   - No replacement tests for modern installation approach
   - Lost test coverage for important functionality

Resolution Applied:

1. IMPROVED TRANSPARENT IMPORT TEST
   - Better error messages explaining what to do
   - Checks for psutil_cygwin availability in development mode
   - Distinguishes between "not installed" and "not configured"
   - Provides clear instructions when transparent import isn't working

2. ADDED MODERN INSTALLATION TESTS
   - TestModernInstallationIntegration: Tests modern setup script
   - TestModernCygwinDetection: Tests Cygwin detection in modern architecture
   - Replaces functionality of removed custom command tests

3. DIAGNOSTIC TOOLING
   - Created diagnose_issue_010.py to help debug transparent import issues
   - Checks environment, .pth file status, and import behavior
   - Provides step-by-step solutions

Expected Behavior After Fix:

ON CYGWIN (target platform):
- If properly installed: 0 skips, all tests pass
- If .pth not configured: Test provides helpful error message and setup instructions
- Modern installation tests verify new architecture works

ON NON-CYGWIN:
- TestRealTransparentImport skipped (correct - requires /proc filesystem)
- Other tests still run and pass (mocked functionality)

Setup Instructions for Zero Skips:

1. Install in development mode:
   pip install -e .

2. Configure transparent import:
   psutil-cygwin-setup install

3. Verify setup:
   psutil-cygwin-check --transparent

4. Run tests:
   pytest tests/test_pth_functionality.py -v
   Expected: 0 skipped, all passed

Files Modified:
- tests/test_pth_functionality.py: Improved test logic and added modern tests
- dev/diagnose_issue_010.py: Created diagnostic tool

Result:
- Better test experience with actionable feedback
- Tests that actually help users configure the system correctly  
- Modern test coverage for new installation architecture
- Zero skips when properly configured on Cygwin

Status: RESOLVED
- Test logic improved to provide better feedback
- Modern installation tests added
- Diagnostic tools created
- Clear setup instructions provided
