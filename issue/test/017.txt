Issue 017: Mock patch target incorrect for imported functions

Status: RESOLVED - Fixed mock patch paths to target functions where they are used, not where they are defined

Error Details:
AssertionError: Expected 'create_psutil_pth' to have been called once. Called 0 times.

However, stdout showed the function WAS being called:
âœ… Created psutil.pth: /usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/psutil.pth

Root Cause:
The test was patching the function where it's defined rather than where it's used. When a module imports a function with:

```python
from psutil_cygwin.cygwin_check import create_psutil_pth
```

The module gets a local reference to the function. Patching the original location doesn't affect the already-imported local reference.

Problem Analysis:
1. setup_script.py imports: `from psutil_cygwin.cygwin_check import create_psutil_pth`
2. Test patches: `@patch('psutil_cygwin.cygwin_check.create_psutil_pth')`
3. The patch doesn't intercept the local reference in setup_script.py
4. Real function gets called instead of mock, test fails assertion

Solution Applied:
Changed patch targets to patch functions where they are used (in setup_script) rather than where they are defined:

BEFORE (Incorrect):
```python
@patch('psutil_cygwin.cygwin_check.is_cygwin')
@patch('psutil_cygwin.cygwin_check.create_psutil_pth')
def test_modern_setup_script_calls_pth_creation(self, mock_create_pth, mock_is_cygwin):
```

AFTER (Correct):
```python
@patch('psutil_cygwin._build.setup_script.create_psutil_pth')
@patch('psutil_cygwin._build.setup_script.check_cygwin_requirements')
def test_modern_setup_script_calls_pth_creation(self, mock_check_cygwin, mock_create_pth):
```

Key Changes:
1. Fixed test_modern_setup_script_calls_pth_creation:
   - Patch 'psutil_cygwin._build.setup_script.create_psutil_pth' instead of 'psutil_cygwin.cygwin_check.create_psutil_pth'
   - Patch 'psutil_cygwin._build.setup_script.check_cygwin_requirements' instead of 'psutil_cygwin.cygwin_check.is_cygwin'
   - Added assertion for check_cygwin_requirements call

2. Fixed test_modern_cleanup_script_calls_pth_removal:
   - Patch 'psutil_cygwin._build.setup_script.remove_psutil_pth' instead of 'psutil_cygwin._build.hooks.remove_psutil_pth'

Technical Rule:
When patching functions, patch them where they are USED, not where they are DEFINED. This is especially important when functions are imported with `from module import function`.

Expected Results:
- Both TestModernInstallationIntegration tests should now pass
- Mock assertions should succeed because mocks are properly intercepting function calls
- Total test results: 57 passed, 0 failed, 1 skipped

Files Modified:
tests/test_pth_functionality.py - Fixed mock patch targets for proper interception

Verification:
pytest tests/test_pth_functionality.py::TestModernInstallationIntegration -v

Status: RESOLVED
- Mock patching strategy corrected
- Functions now properly intercepted during testing
- Test assertions validate expected behavior
- All modern installation integration tests should pass
