## [1.0.0] - 2025-01-XX

### Added
- Initial release of psutil-cygwin
- Complete psutil-compatible API for Cygwin environments
- **Transparent psutil replacement via .pth file mechanism**
- **Automatic psutil.pth creation during installation**
- **Cygwin-only installation with comprehensive environment validation**
- System information functions (CPU, memory, disk, network)
- Process management and monitoring capabilities
- Full exception compatibility with psutil
- Comprehensive test suite with unit and integration tests
- Complete documentation with Sphinx
- Console scripts for system monitoring and process management
- **Enhanced psutil-cygwin-check with transparent import verification**
- Performance optimizations for /proc filesystem access
- Support for Python 3.6+

### Features
- **System Functions**:
  - `cpu_times()` - CPU time statistics
  - `cpu_percent()` - CPU usage percentage
  - `cpu_count()` - Number of CPU cores
  - `virtual_memory()` - Memory statistics
  - `swap_memory()` - Swap memory information
  - `disk_usage()` - Disk usage for paths
  - `disk_partitions()` - Mounted disk partitions
  - `disk_io_counters()` - Disk I/O statistics
  - `net_connections()` - Network connections
  - `net_io_counters()` - Network I/O statistics
  - `boot_time()` - System boot time
  - `users()` - Logged in users

- **Process Management**:
  - `pids()` - List all process IDs
  - `process_iter()` - Iterate over processes
  - `pid_exists()` - Check if PID exists
  - `Process` class with full psutil compatibility
  - Process information: name, executable, command line, status
  - Process resources: memory, CPU times, open files
  - Process relationships: parent, children, process tree
  - Process control: terminate, kill, wait

- **Exception Classes**:
  - `NoSuchProcess` - Process not found
  - `AccessDenied` - Permission denied
  - `TimeoutExpired` - Operation timeout

- **Console Scripts**:
  - `psutil-cygwin-monitor` - Real-time system monitoring
  - `psutil-cygwin-proc` - Process management utility
  - `psutil-cygwin-check` - Environment validation and transparent import verification

- **Transparent Import System**:
  - Automatic `psutil.pth` file creation during installation
  - Makes `import psutil` transparently use psutil_cygwin
  - Comprehensive environment validation (Cygwin-only installation)
  - Automatic `.pth` file cleanup during uninstallation
  - Multiple verification methods via `psutil-cygwin-check`

### Implementation Details
- Pure Python implementation using only standard library
- Direct /proc filesystem access for optimal performance
- Comprehensive error handling and edge case management
- Memory-efficient process iteration with lazy loading
- Cached system information for frequently accessed data
- Cross-platform address parsing for network connections
- Robust file reading with proper exception handling

### Documentation
- Complete Sphinx documentation with RTD theme
- Installation guide with troubleshooting
- Quick start guide with practical examples
- Full API reference with docstrings
- Compatibility matrix with standard psutil
- Development guide for contributors
- Performance optimization tips

### Testing
- Unit tests with mocking for core functionality
- Integration tests requiring real Cygwin environment
- Performance benchmarks and stress tests
- Error condition testing and edge cases
- Continuous integration setup ready
- Test coverage reporting

### Performance Optimizations
- Efficient /proc file parsing with minimal I/O
- Lazy loading of process information
- Cached boot time and CPU count
- Optimized network address parsing
- Batch process information gathering
- Memory-conscious large process list handling

### Known Limitations
- Network connections cannot be mapped to specific processes
- Some Windows-specific CPU statistics not available
- Swap I/O statistics require additional /proc/vmstat parsing
- Process creation time accuracy depends on system clock tick resolution

## [Unreleased]

### Planned for 1.1.0
- Enhanced network connection to process mapping
- Additional process statistics from /proc files
- Windows registry integration for system information
- Performance monitoring and profiling tools
- Extended compatibility with more psutil features
- Plugin architecture for custom data sources

### Under Consideration
- Asynchronous API for high-performance applications
- WebSocket-based real-time monitoring
- Export to various formats (JSON, XML, CSV)
- Integration with system monitoring tools
- Docker container support
- Advanced process filtering and search capabilities

## Development Notes

### Version Numbering
- Major version: Breaking changes to public API
- Minor version: New features, backward compatible
- Patch version: Bug fixes, performance improvements

### Release Process
1. Update version in `pyproject.toml` and `__init__.py`
2. Update this changelog with release notes
3. Run full test suite on target Cygwin environments
4. Create and test source distribution
5. Tag release and push to repository
6. Upload to PyPI
7. Update documentation

### Compatibility Promise
psutil-cygwin maintains API compatibility with standard psutil within the same major version. Any breaking changes will result in a major version increment.

### Support Policy
- Latest major version: Full support with new features and bug fixes
- Previous major version: Security fixes and critical bug fixes for 12 months
- Older versions: Community support only
